# Dependecies
To run a project made with OpenGL and C++, you need several dependencies:

OpenGL Library: Core graphics library for rendering.

GLFW or SDL: For window creation and input handling.

GLEW or GLAD: For managing OpenGL extensions.

GLM: For mathematics operations, such as vectors and matrices.

C++ Compiler: A standard C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or MSVC.

Build System: Tools like CMake for managing the build process.

Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or an editor like VSCode.

Ensure these dependencies are correctly installed and configured in your development environment to compile and run your OpenGL project efficiently.
